## The challenges during the making:
There were multiple challenges during the making of the project, mainly at planning and time management aspects.
### Procrastination
One of the most significant challenges encountered during the project was procrastination. To address this challenge, I broke the project down into smaller tasks, and deadlines were set for each task. 

### Workload from other subjects
Another challenge encountered during the project was the workload from other subjects. To manage this challenge, I allocated all of my time and energy to complete the assignments of that subject. Ultimately, I managed to complete this assigment in a timely fashion.
